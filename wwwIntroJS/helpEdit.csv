1;#stepSelect;Select the file you want to edit using the drop down menu. Select the respective cluster you want to correct and draw a rectangle around the droplets that should be assigned to it in the grey on white plot. Click 'Save Changes' to save your changes and continue with the next cluster or well, or click 'Revert Changes' to discard your changes and restore the original result.; auto
2;#stepEditPlots;On the left side, you can see a grey on white representation of the raw data. You can select any area by clicking with your mouse and holding the button to draw a rectangle. These droplets will be re-assigned to the cluster you selected in the menu on the left. The coloured plot to the right is updated live, so you can check if your changes are correct. Remember to save your changes before continuing with the next cluster or well.; auto
3;#stepRerun;The software's parameters are tweaked to work well with most experiments. However, sometimes the algorithm performes poorly, because the data is very sparse or very dense. You can change the sensitivity and run the algorithm again for each well separately by clicking the 'Re-Run' button. A higher sensitivity will separate the data into more clusters, a lower value will result in fewer clusters.; auto
3;#stepCount2;Lastly, don't forget to click 'Count Droplets!' to accept the result and count the droplets!; auto
